# Machine Learning
Late last year I have promised myself that starting 2020, I will learn AI/ML and its applications. After doing a considerable amount of research over the holidays, I have created an outline of the syllabus on [trello](https://trello.com/b/WTAfa9fW) and this repository, where I plan to track my progress, upload the projects/code that I will be developing as a part of my ML journey. Please note, that the syllabus, order of lessons/courses, etc. are still very fluid - it is still the first week of Jan :). As I finish the courses get a hang of the subject, I will keep updating this readme file, repo, and the trello board, as well. I have created the trello board as a template for anyone to copy it, which is why there are no courses in *WIP* or *Completed* lists. I will be updating my progress on this page, instead.

I promise that I will provide more details about my background, why ML, why I've chosen what I've chosen, my experiences with each course/book/video, and all other details, in due course of time. Until then, I think it should suffice to say that I am an absolute newbie to ML, with familiarity with the underlying concepts, like Linear Algebra, Calculus, Statistics, Probability, and have decent programming knowledge.

If I am a beginner looking for resources to learn ML from scratch in 2020, I'd copy the above trello board and modify it according to my skills and background.

Happy Learning!!
