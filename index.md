### Intro

Late last year I have promised myself that starting 2020, I will learn Machine Learning and apply it to my discipline of Dynamics and Control Systems. After doing a considerable amount of research over the holidays of 2019, I have created an outline of the syllabus and created a [trello board](https://trello.com/b/WTAfa9fW) where I plan to track my progress. I will upload the projects and the code that I will be developing as a part of my ML journey.

As I finish the courses get a hang of the subject, I will keep updating this readme file, repo, and the trello board, as well. I have created the trello board as a template for anyone to copy it, which is why there are no courses in WIP or Completed lists. I will be updating my progress on this page, instead.

I promise that I will provide more details about my background, why ML, why I've chosen what I've chosen, my experiences with each course/book/video, and all other details, in due course of time. Until then, I think it should suffice to say that I am an absolute newbie to ML, with familiarity with the underlying concepts, like Linear Algebra, Calculus, Statistics, Probability, and have decent programming knowledge.

If I am a beginner looking for resources to learn ML from scratch in 2020, I'd copy the above trello board and modify it according to my skills and background.

Happy Learning!!
